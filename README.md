# GameShowApp

This project is the 3rd project in the Treehouse Techdegree course | https://bit.ly/3PKd1uP |
Its essentially a game of hangman or wheel of fortune, you attempt to guess each letter to the random sentence, you allowed 5 wrong guesses before you lose. guess the whole sentence right and you win!

I used css and plain javascript to write this code.
